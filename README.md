# gen X

The **goal** of this project is to **increase and accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology**.
<br />
Through this solution, developers will be able to automatically generate entire React.js dApps starting from the ABI of smart contracts; those, in order to be compatible with this solution, **must be** written in Rust, **using the MultiversX framework**.
<br />
The dApp will be configured with the libraries made available by the MultiversX team to facilitate the interactions with the blockchain and smart contracts.
<br />
<br />
A Proof of Concept has already been developed as my graduation project. This POC is very limited as it allows the generation of dApps from relatively simple smart contracts; for example, the POC version covers only the Rust and framework basic types, completely ignoring custom types defined via struct or enums.
Another limitation is that the generated components are not assembled; this means, that the programmer has to assemble the components based on how they interact with each other.
<br />
<br />
For the participation in the hackathon, the development of the project started again from 0 sever times, but the final version is represented by this repository. We started from scratch again, with the goal to fix some bugs present in the POC version and, most importantly, to allow proper implementation of the limitations described above.
<br />
<br />
Thus, the final version will be more versatile and will be compatible with a greater variance of smart contracts.

![Solution architecture][app-archi]

[Back to ‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#gen-x "Back to 'Table of contents' section")

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Getting started

### Prerequisites:

- JavaScript runtime **[node.js][node]**;
- Rust toolchain **[rustup, rustc, cargo][rust]**;
- **OPTIONAL**:
  - Alternative package manager:
    - **[pnpm][pnpm]**: `npm install --global pnpm` <br /> or
    - **[yarn][yarn]**: `npm install --global yarn`;
  - **[cargo-watch][cargo-watch]**: `cargo install cargo-watch`;

### Local development:

- Get the repository: `git clone https://github.com/doinel1a/gen-x`;
- Open your terminal or code editor to the path the project is located, and run:

  - In the root `/` folder:

    |                                 | **npm**       | **pnpm**       | **yarn**       |
    | ------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
    | To **install** the dependencies | `npm install` | `pnpm install` | `yarn install` |

  - In the `front-end` folder:

    |                                                        | **npm**           | **pnpm**       | **yarn**       |
    | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
    | To **install** the dependencies                        | `npm install`     | `pnpm install` | `yarn install` |
    | To **run** the **development server** **\***           | `npm run dev`     | `pnpm dev`     | `yarn dev`     |
    | To **build** the app **for production**                | `npm run build`   | `pnpm build`   | `yarn build`   |
    | To **preview** the **production optimized app** **\*** | `npm run preview` | `pnpm preview` | `yarn preview` |

    **\*** The **front-end interface** will be accessible at the following url: `http://localhost:3000`.

  - In the `back-end` folder:

    |                                                                | **Cargo**               |
    | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
    | To **run** the back-end in **development mode** **\***         | `cargo run`             |
    | To **run** the back-end in **development & watch mode** **\*** | `cargo watch -x "run"`  |
    | To **run** the back-end in **production mode** **\***          | `cargo run --release`   |
    | To **build** the back-end **for production**                   | `cargo build --release` |

    **\*** <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The **API** will be accessible at the following url: `http://localhost:8080`. <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp; The available endpoints are:

    - /api/v1/healthcheck
    - /api/v1/generate

[Back to ‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#gen-x "Back to 'Table of contents' section")

---

## üõ† How to

As per today, **Wednesday 11 October**, the API is not yet deployed in the cloud. <br />
The only way to test the solutions is to run it locally:

1. **[Get started](#Ô∏è-getting-started "Go to 'Getting started' section");**
2. Build and run the API;
3. In your favourite API client:
   1. Set the HTTP Method to `POST`;
   2. Set the url as `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/generate`;
   3. Select `Body` and then `JSON`;
   4. Insert a JSON which must have the following structure:
      ```json
      {
        "sc_abi": {
          "name": "SC name",
          "constructor": {
            "inputs": [ . . . ],
            "outputs": [ . . . ]
          },
          "endpoints": [ . . . ],
          "events": [ . . . ] ,
          "hasCallback": false,
          "types": { . . . }
        }
      }
      ```
      **To enable the rendering feature of a endpoint inside a specific page, insert in the documentation of each endpoint a field like `path: /pages/page1`; otherwise it will be rendered in its predefined folder**
   5. Send request;
   6. Download .zip project;
